A couple weeks ago I finished my second Raspberry Pi project. The first was installing XMBC. It failed to fully replace the Apple TV. 

[Darksky-in-Pi](https://github.com/smit1678/darksky-in-pi) is my new project. It uses the [Dark Sky Forecast API](https://developer.forecast.io/) and an [LCD screen](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16x2-character-lcd-plus-keypad-for-raspberry-pi/overview). It's not complete, but progress has been made:
